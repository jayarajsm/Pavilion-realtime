## 💡 How It Works

Each deployed instance of Pavilion is **one league**. Your friend group forks this repo, adds their own player roster, and deploys to Netlify. That's it — no accounts, no databases, no shared infrastructure.

- **Players** are defined in `data/players-cache.json`
- **Matches** are added as CSV files in `data/matches/`
- **League name** is set in `data/config.json`
- **Scoring** happens automatically based on the CSV data

Push a match CSV → the site updates live.

<br/>

<br/>

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/iambalabharathi/Pavilion.git
cd Pavilion

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the dev server
npm start
```

Open **http://localhost:3001** and you're good to go.

## 🎯 Setting Up Your League

Before anything else, you need to configure two files:

<br/>

### 1. Player Roster — `data/players-cache.json`

This is the heart of your league. It's a JSON array where each player looks like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 13,
    "name": "Shubman Gill",
    "category": "Batter",
    "iplTeam": "GT",
    "foreign": "Indian",
    "fantasyTeam": "Ragu",
    "soldPrice": 18
  },
  {
    "id": 20,
    "name": "Rinku Singh",
    "category": "Batter",
    "iplTeam": "KKR",
    "foreign": "Indian",
    "fantasyTeam": "Ragu",
    "soldPrice": 11
  }
]
```

<br/>

**Field reference:**

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | Yes | Unique player ID (used to match CSV rows) |
| `name` | Yes | Player's display name |
| `fantasyTeam` | Yes | Which fantasy team owns this player |
| `category` | No | `Batter`, `Bowler`, `All-rounder`, or `Wicketkeeper` |
| `iplTeam` | No | IPL franchise code (`CSK`, `MI`, `RCB`, etc.) |
| `foreign` | No | `Indian` or `Overseas` |
| `soldPrice` | No | Auction price |

<br/>

> **Tip:** The repo already includes a sample roster at `data/players-cache.json` with 120+ players across 8 fantasy teams. You can use it as a reference or replace it entirely with your own.

<br/>

Teams are **auto-detected** from the `fantasyTeam` field — no need to list them separately.

<br/>

### 2. League Name — `data/config.json`

A simple file that sets your league's display name:

```json
{
  "name": "IPL 2026 Fantasy League"
}
```

Change this to whatever you want — it shows up in the header and browser tab.

<br/>

### 3. Deploy

Once both files are in place, commit and push. The site loads directly into the dashboard — no setup screens, no configuration UI.

<br/>

## 🏏 Adding a Match Score

This is the main thing you'll be doing after the league is set up.

There are two ways to add a match:

<br/>

### Method 1: From Cricbuzz Scorecard (Recommended)

This parses a raw scorecard text file and auto-generates the CSV.

<br/>

**Step 1** — Create a raw text file in `data/raw/`:

```
data/raw/match-10.txt
```

<br/>

**Step 2** — Go to the **Cricbuzz scorecard** for the match. Copy the **full batting + bowling tables** for both innings and paste them into the file. It should look like this:

```
Chennai Super Kings  (20 ovs maximum)
Batting	 	R	B	M	4s	6s	SR
Ayush Mhatre
c Maphaka b Deshpande
43	20	29	8	1	215.00
Devon Conway
c Jurel b Yudhvir Singh
10	8	7	2	0	125.00
...

Bowling	O	M	R	W	NB	WD	ECO
Tushar Deshpande 	4	0	47	1	0	1	11.75
Trent Boult 	4	0	51	0	1	0	12.75
...
```

> **Tip:** Copy from the Cricbuzz page starting from the team name heading, through both innings (batting + bowling for each team).

<br/>

**Step 3** — Run the parser:

```bash
node parse-match.js data/raw/match-10.txt
```

This creates `data/matches/match-10.csv` with all stats filled in.

> Use `--force` to overwrite an existing match file:
> ```bash
> node parse-match.js data/raw/match-10.txt --force
> ```

<br/>

**Step 4** — Review the generated CSV, then commit & push:

```bash
git add data/
git commit -m "Match 10 data added"
git push
```

The site auto-deploys on Netlify after push.

<br/>

<br/>

### Method 2: Generate Template & Fill Manually

If you prefer to fill in stats yourself from the scorecard:

<br/>

**Step 1** — Generate a blank match template:

```bash
node generate-match.js <team1> <team2> <matchNumber>
```

Example:

```bash
node generate-match.js CSK MI 10
```

**Valid IPL teams:** `CSK`, `DC`, `GT`, `KKR`, `LSG`, `MI`, `PBKS`, `RCB`, `RR`, `SRH`

This creates `data/matches/match-10.csv` with all players from both teams, stats set to `0`.

<br/>

**Step 2** — Open the CSV and fill in stats from the Cricbuzz scorecard:

```
# CSK vs MI - Match 10
# 2026-04-05
#
# id, name, ipl_team, fantasy_team, playing, mom, runs, 4s, 6s, wkts, dots, maidens, lbw_b_hw, catches, ro_direct, ro_indirect, stumpings

# --- CSK ---
1, MS Dhoni, CSK, Ragu, 1, 0, 45, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0
2, Ravindra Jadeja, CSK, Dots, 1, 1, 32, 2, 1, 2, 8, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0
...
```

<br/>

**Step 3** — Commit & push:

```bash
git add data/matches/match-10.csv
git commit -m "Match 10 data added"
git push
```

<br/>

<br/>

## 📄 CSV Format Reference

Each match is a CSV file at `data/matches/match-<N>.csv`.

<br/>

### Header comments

| Line | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| Line 1 | `# <Title>` | `# RCB vs PBKS - Match 1` |

<br/>

### Columns

| Column | Description | Values |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| `id` | Player ID (from `players-cache.json`) | Integer |
| `name` | Player name | String |
| `ipl_team` | IPL franchise | `CSK`, `MI`, `RCB`, etc. |
| `fantasy_team` | Fantasy team owner | `Ragu`, `RK`, `Darshan`, etc. |
| `playing` | In Playing 12? | `1` = yes, `0` = no |
| `mom` | Man of the Match? | `1` = yes, `0` = no |

<br/>

### Special cases

- **Abandoned match** — Add `# abandoned` as a comment line. All points become 0.

- **Players not in Playing 12** — Keep `playing` as `0`. They get 0 points.
